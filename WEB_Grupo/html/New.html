          <p>Our teammate Juan Mar√≠a Jusue has announced that he's working in a new project named 'Amnesia', based on the critically acclaimed visual novel with the same name. Here he wants to show you all a bit of the story behind this WIP tittle:</p>
          <blockquote cite="">
              <p>The story begins with the heroine trying to escape a burning church, followed by a vision of her drowning. Afterward, she awakens in the back room of a cafe, with no memories, as people who seem to know her argue about how to help her. A strangely dressed boy named Orion appears, floating in midair, and explains that he is a spirit whom only the heroine can see or hear. He informs her that she lost her memories from before August 1st, three days ago, due to his carelessness, and he will try to help her recover them. He advises her to keep her amnesia a secret.</p>

              <p>The heroine starts regaining small pieces of her memories. She finds a picture of her with her face scribbled out in her mailbox. As she walks home, a group of girls confront the heroine saying that she broke their "promise". The heroine remembers the girls attacking her, and faints...
              </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Amazing! Isn't it? Stay tuned for more information of the development state of this project!</p>

    <h1 class="NewsText">Unity Masterclass</h1>
    <img src="../images/article-image-2.jpg" alt="">  
          <p>Our lead programmer, Alberto Jacinto, has announced a new Unity Masterclass on the upcoming weeks. But first of all, what's Unity?</p>
          <blockquote cite=""><p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies and used to develop video games for PC, consoles, mobile devices and websites. First announced only for OS X, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, it has since been extended to target 21 platforms. Nintendo provides free licenses of Unity 5 to all licensed Nintendo Developers along with their software development kits (SDKs) for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS Family.

          Five major versions of Unity have been released. At the 2006 WWDC show, Apple named Unity as the runner up for its Best Use of Mac OS X Graphics category.</p>
        </blockquote>
          <p>On 12th May 2017 our lead programmer will show you the Unity Basics. Everything needed to build a project from scratch. The Masterclass will take place in our Montreal Studios and you all will be able to do your own project by the end of the lesson.</p>
